# technical_store_sale_analysis
I have created a Project which can Analyze Data of Sales in a technical store to know about the trends for products, timings and month wise sales.
I have used multiple Python libraries like :
1) Pandas for creating Dataframes.
2) Matplotlib library for detailed and insightful visualization of the multiple aspects of sales in the store.
# Features of my project
1) Preprocessing the data
2) Visualizing Sales per month
3) Visualizing Sales per city
4) Plotting graph for sales vs time of day
5) Visualizing products sold for particular products
6) Comparing cost of item to quantity sold
